# 2DTileGame

A small, basic 2D tile game made for my high school computer science class by my friend and I, has randomly generating levels, with entities, very basic combat, and multiple gamestates.

All sprites were hand made by me in a program called Piskel. Method and class specific authors are referenced in java doc comments for each method.
